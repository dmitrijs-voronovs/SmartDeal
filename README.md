# Multi-step payment tracking dapp &quot;Smart deal&quot;

## Problem

Multi-step business deals, agile projects, complex agreements have a common issue of payment tracking and fulfillment. Usually a 3rd party has to be involved to control if deliverables are completed and an agreed sum of money for each stage is paid in time.

## Solution

&quot;Smart deal&quot; is a convenient and reliable decentralized system that helps to define monetary agreement between a client and an agent. Moreover, It helps to prevent deals with unqualified agents by storing history of completed deals, reviews and ratings.

&quot;Smart deal&quot; solution includes a convenient web-based portal with authorized consultants that help to create an agreement and resolve all the issues.
